The typical interest rate of a two year loan in the United Kingdom is [around 10%](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/whats-a-good-interest-rate-for-a-personal-loan/). This might not sound like a lot, but in September 2022 alone UK consumers borrowed [around £1.5 billion](https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/system/files/2022-12/Household%20Finance%20Review%202022%20Q3-%20Final.pdf), which would mean approximately £300 million in interest generated by banks over two years!\n","\n","## Problem\n","\n","I have been asked to work with a bank to clean and store the data they collected as part of a recent marketing campaign, which aimed to get customers to take out a personal loan. They plan to conduct more marketing campaigns going forward so would like you to set up a PostgreSQL database to store this campaign's data. I need to design the schema in a way that would allow data from future campaigns to be easily imported.\n","\n","They have supplied the current campaign data as a csv file called `\"bank_marketing.csv\"`\n","\n","## Solution\n","\n","I clean, reformat, and split their source data in order to populate the database. I then provide SQL code that the bank can execute to create the tables and populate with the data from the csv files. As the bank are quite strict about their security, I provide the database design script as a `.sql` file that they can then run themselves.\n","\n","### Database schema\n","\n","## client\n","\n","|
